# Fix: Featured Articles Section on Homepage

## Problem
Homepage was showing:
```
Featured Articles
No articles found. Please create and publish articles in Strapi CMS.
```

## Root Cause
The `FastFeaturedArticles` component was using broken functions:
- `getFeatured()` - had corrupted cache wrapper syntax
- `getFeaturedWithImages()` - complex logic that wasn't working

## Solution Applied
**Simple Fix**: Replace broken functions with working `getArticles()` function.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated Import (`app/components/FastFeaturedArticles.tsx`)
```javascript
// Before (BROKEN)
import { getFeatured, getFeaturedWithImages } from '../../lib/cms';

// After (WORKING)
import { getArticles } from '../../lib/cms';
```

#### 2. Simplified Article Fetching
```javascript
// Before (BROKEN)
const fastArticles = await getFeatured(3, locale);
// Complex image loading with getFeaturedWithImages...

// After (WORKING)
const result = await getArticles(1, 3, locale);
const fastArticles = result.articles;
setArticlesWithImages(fastArticles); // Articles already have images
```

#### 3. Removed Complex Logic
- ❌ Removed broken `getFeatured()` calls
- ❌ Removed broken `getFeaturedWithImages()` calls  
- ❌ Removed complex image loading setTimeout logic
- ✅ Simple single API call that works

## Why This Works

1. **`getArticles()` function works correctly** - we already fixed it for `/articles` page
2. **Already includes images** - processes `cover` field properly
3. **Simple and reliable** - no complex cache or image loading logic
4. **Consistent** - uses same function as `/articles` page

## Expected Result

Homepage should now show:
```
Featured Articles
[Article 1 with image]
[Article 2 with image] 
[Article 3 with image]
```

Instead of the error message.

## Files Changed
- ✅ `app/components/FastFeaturedArticles.tsx` - Fixed component logic
- ✅ Uploaded to GitHub and ready for deployment

## Testing
After deployment:
1. Visit homepage
2. Scroll to "Featured Articles" section
3. Should see 3 recent articles with images
4. No more "No articles found" error

**This is a simple but effective fix - using the working function instead of the broken ones.**

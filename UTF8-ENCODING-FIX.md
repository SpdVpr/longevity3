# CRITICAL FIX: UTF-8 Encoding Issue Resolved

## Build Error
The Vercel deployment was failing with this UTF-8 encoding error:
```
./lib/cms.ts
Error: Failed to read source code from /vercel/path0/lib/cms.ts
Caused by: stream did not contain valid UTF-8
```

## Root Cause Analysis
**CRITICAL ISSUE**: Windows PowerShell was creating files with UTF-16 encoding instead of UTF-8.

### Problem Details:
1. **File Creation Issue**: When creating `lib/cms.ts` using PowerShell commands, the file was saved with UTF-16 encoding
2. **Character Spacing**: Every character was separated by spaces (UTF-16 byte order mark issue)
3. **Build Failure**: Next.js/Webpack couldn't read the file due to invalid UTF-8 encoding
4. **Multiple Attempts Failed**: Various PowerShell commands (`Out-File`, `echo`, `New-Item`) all produced the same encoding issue

### Example of Corrupted Content:
```
��/ * * 
 
   *   C M S   s e r v i c e   w i t h   c a c h i n g 
 
   * / 
```

Instead of:
```javascript
/**
 * CMS service with caching
 */
```

## Solution Applied
**Smart Workaround**: Instead of fighting with Windows PowerShell encoding issues, changed the import path to use the existing working file.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. ✅ Fixed Import Path (`app/components/FastFeaturedArticles.tsx`)
```javascript
// Before (BROKEN - pointing to non-existent/corrupted file)
import { getArticles } from '../../lib/cms';

// After (WORKING - pointing to existing file with proper encoding)
import { getArticles } from '../lib/cms';
```

#### 2. ✅ Removed Problematic File
- Deleted the corrupted `lib/cms.ts` file
- Uses existing `app/lib/cms.ts` which has proper UTF-8 encoding

#### 3. ✅ Path Resolution
- `../../lib/cms` → `../lib/cms` 
- From `app/components/` directory:
  - `../lib/cms` = `app/lib/cms.ts` ✅ (exists, proper encoding)
  - `../../lib/cms` = `lib/cms.ts` ❌ (corrupted/missing)

## Why This Solution Works

1. **Existing File**: `app/lib/cms.ts` already exists and has proper UTF-8 encoding
2. **Same Functions**: Contains the same `getArticles()` function needed by `FastFeaturedArticles`
3. **No Encoding Issues**: File was created properly, not through PowerShell
4. **Simpler Path**: Uses relative path that actually points to an existing file

## Expected Results

### Build Should Succeed:
- ✅ No more UTF-8 encoding errors
- ✅ No more "Failed to read source code" errors
- ✅ Vercel deployment should complete successfully

### Homepage Should Work:
- ✅ Featured Articles section should display articles
- ✅ No more "No articles found" error message
- ✅ Articles should include cover images (from previous fixes)

## Files Changed
- ✅ **`app/components/FastFeaturedArticles.tsx`** - Fixed import path
- ✅ **Removed `lib/cms.ts`** - Deleted corrupted file
- ✅ **Uploaded to GitHub** - Ready for deployment

## Lessons Learned
1. **Windows PowerShell Encoding**: PowerShell on Windows can create files with UTF-16 encoding by default
2. **UTF-8 Requirement**: Next.js/Webpack requires UTF-8 encoding for TypeScript files
3. **Simple Solutions**: Sometimes it's better to use existing working files than create new ones
4. **Path Resolution**: Relative imports need to point to actual existing files

## Testing After Deployment
1. **Check build logs** - Should show successful compilation without UTF-8 errors
2. **Visit homepage** - Featured Articles should display
3. **Check browser console** - Should see article loading logs
4. **Verify images** - Articles should show cover images

**This was a Windows-specific encoding issue that was resolved by using the existing properly-encoded file instead of creating a new one with PowerShell.**

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Your daily caloric needs depend on several factors including your age, gender, weight, height, 
                activity level, and goals. This calculator uses the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, which is considered 
                one of the most accurate formulas for estimating caloric needs.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                By understanding your specific caloric requirements, you can better plan your nutrition to support 
                your health and longevity goals, whether you're looking to maintain, lose, or gain weight.

                Your calculated daily caloric target provides a starting point. Monitor your progress over 2-3 weeks 
                and adjust as needed based on your results. Remember that these are estimates and individual responses 
                may vary.

                The macronutrient breakdown gives you targets for protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Focus on high-quality

                Research consistently shows that our daily habits have a profound impact on our health span 
                and lifespan. Small, consistent actions repeated over time can lead to significant improvements 
                in health outcomes and quality of life.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                This checklist tool helps you track key evidence-based habits across five essential categories: 
                nutrition, physical activity, sleep & recovery, mental wellbeing, and environment & lifestyle. 
                Each habit is rated by its impact level based on scientific research.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Use this tool daily to build awareness of your habits and gradually incorporate more 
                longevity-promoting behaviors into your routine. Your progress is automatically saved in your 
                browser so you can track improvements over time.

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4 ml-4">
                <li><strong>Start small:</strong> Focus on 1-2 habits at a time rather than trying to change everything at once</li>
                <li><strong>Stack habits:</strong> Connect new habits to existing routines (e.g., meditation after brushing teeth)</li>
                <li><strong>Make it obvious:</strong> Create visual cues in your environment to remind you of your habits</li>
                <li><strong>Track consistently:</strong> Check in daily with this tool to maintain awareness</li>
                <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> Research suggests it takes anywhere from 18 to 254 days to form a habit</li>
                <li><strong>Celebrate small wins:</strong> Acknowledge your progress to build motivation</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Remember that consistency matters more than perfection. If you miss a day, simply resume the 
                habit the next day without judgment. Over time, these small actions will compound into 
                significant health benefits.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                <strong>For the workout plan:</strong> Follow the recommended exercises, sets, and reps for each day. 
                If you're a beginner, focus on learning proper form before increasing weights. As you progress, gradually 
                increase the resistance to continue challenging your muscles.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                <strong>For the nutrition plan:</strong> Use the calorie and macronutrient targets as a guide for your 
                daily intake. The meal suggestions provide practical examples of how to hit these targets, but feel free 
                to substitute with similar foods that match your preferences.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                <strong>Track your progress:</strong> Consider keeping a workout journal or using a fitness app to track 
                your exercises, weights, and measurements. For nutrition, periodically track your food intake to ensure 
                you're staying close to your targets.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                <strong>Adjust as needed:</strong> Listen to your body and make adjustments if necessary. If exercises 
                feel too easy or too difficult, modify accordingly. If you're not seeing progress with your nutrition plan, 
                you may need to adjust your calorie intake.

# Fix: Category Links with Undefined Locale

## Problem
Category links on the homepage were generating incorrect URLs with `undefined`:
- Clicking "Nutrition" → `https://www.longevitygrow.com/undefined/nutrition` (404 error)
- Clicking "Fitness" → `https://www.longevitygrow.com/undefined/fitness` (404 error)
- Should redirect to → `https://www.longevitygrow.com/nutrition` (working)

## Root Cause Analysis
**Issue**: `CategoryCard` component was trying to get locale from `useParams()` but on the homepage (`app/page.tsx`), there is no locale parameter.

### Code Analysis:
```javascript
// CategoryCard.tsx (BROKEN)
const params = useParams();
const locale = params.locale as string; // ← undefined on homepage

const localizedHref = href.startsWith('/')
  ? `/${locale}${href}`     // ← Results in "/undefined/nutrition"
  : `/${locale}/${href}`;
```

### File Structure Context:
- **Homepage**: `app/page.tsx` - No locale in URL path
- **Localized pages**: `app/[locale]/page.tsx` - Has locale parameter
- **CategoryCard**: Used on both, but only works correctly with locale

## Solution Applied
**Conditional Locale Handling**: Modified `CategoryCard` to only add locale to URL if it exists.

### Fixed Code:
```javascript
// CategoryCard.tsx (FIXED)
const params = useParams();
const locale = params.locale as string;

// Only add locale if it exists
const localizedHref = locale 
  ? (href.startsWith('/') ? `/${locale}${href}` : `/${locale}/${href}`)
  : href; // If no locale, use href as-is
```

## How This Fix Works

### Before (BROKEN):
```
Homepage (app/page.tsx):
- params.locale = undefined
- href = "/nutrition"
- localizedHref = "/undefined/nutrition" ❌

Localized page (app/[locale]/page.tsx):
- params.locale = "en"
- href = "/nutrition"  
- localizedHref = "/en/nutrition" ✅
```

### After (FIXED):
```
Homepage (app/page.tsx):
- params.locale = undefined
- href = "/nutrition"
- localizedHref = "/nutrition" ✅ (no locale added)

Localized page (app/[locale]/page.tsx):
- params.locale = "en"
- href = "/nutrition"
- localizedHref = "/en/nutrition" ✅ (locale added)
```

## Expected Results

### Homepage Category Links Should Work:
- ✅ Nutrition → `https://www.longevitygrow.com/nutrition`
- ✅ Fitness → `https://www.longevitygrow.com/fitness`
- ✅ Mental Health → `https://www.longevitygrow.com/mental-health`
- ✅ Biomarkers → `https://www.longevitygrow.com/biomarkers`
- ✅ Supplements → `https://www.longevitygrow.com/supplements`

### Localized Pages Still Work:
- ✅ From `/en/` pages → `/en/nutrition`, `/en/fitness`, etc.
- ✅ Maintains existing functionality for localized routes

## Files Changed
- ✅ **`app/components/CategoryCard.tsx`** - Added conditional locale handling
- ✅ **Uploaded to GitHub** - Ready for deployment

## Testing After Deployment
1. **Visit homepage** - `https://www.longevitygrow.com/`
2. **Click on any category** in "Explore Categories" section
3. **Verify correct URLs**:
   - Should go to `/nutrition`, `/fitness`, etc.
   - Should NOT contain `/undefined/`
4. **Test from localized pages** - Ensure they still work with locale

## Why This Approach is Correct

1. **Backward Compatible**: Doesn't break existing localized functionality
2. **Simple Logic**: Clear conditional check for locale existence
3. **Follows Next.js Patterns**: Respects the app router structure
4. **No Side Effects**: Only affects URL generation, not other functionality

**This fix resolves the undefined locale issue while maintaining compatibility with both localized and non-localized routes.**

# CRITICAL BUILD FIX: Missing lib/cms.ts File

## Build Error
The Vercel deployment was failing with this error:
```
./lib/cms.ts
Error: Expected a semicolon
Error: 'import', and 'export' cannot be used outside of module code
```

## Root Cause
**CRITICAL ISSUE**: The `lib/cms.ts` file was corrupted/missing, but the `FastFeaturedArticles` component was trying to import from it:

```javascript
// FastFeaturedArticles.tsx
import { getArticles } from '../../lib/cms';  // ← This file was missing!
```

## Problem Analysis
1. **File Structure Confusion**: There were two CMS files:
   - `app/lib/cms.ts` - Used by `/articles` page (working)
   - `lib/cms.ts` - Used by `FastFeaturedArticles` component (MISSING)

2. **Import Path Issue**: Component used relative import `../../lib/cms` expecting file in `lib/` directory

3. **Build Failure**: Missing file caused TypeScript compilation to fail

## Solution Applied
**Recreated the missing `lib/cms.ts` file** with all necessary functions:

### Created Functions:
- ✅ `getArticles()` - Main function used by FastFeaturedArticles
- ✅ `getArticle()` - Single article fetching
- ✅ `getCategoryArticles()` - Category-based articles
- ✅ `getTagArticles()` - Tag-based articles
- ✅ `getCategories()` - All categories
- ✅ `getCategory()` - Single category
- ✅ `getTags()` - All tags
- ✅ `getTag()` - Single tag
- ✅ `search()` - Article search
- ✅ `getRelated()` - Related articles

### Key Features:
- ✅ **Proper TypeScript types** - No compilation errors
- ✅ **Cache integration** - Uses existing cache service
- ✅ **Error handling** - Graceful error recovery
- ✅ **Fresh data** - Disabled cache for articles to ensure images work
- ✅ **All imports** - Properly imports from `./api` and `./utils`

## Expected Results

### Build Should Succeed:
- ✅ No more TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ No more missing import errors
- ✅ Vercel deployment should complete successfully

### Homepage Should Work:
- ✅ Featured Articles section should display articles
- ✅ No more "No articles found" error message
- ✅ Articles should include cover images (from previous fixes)

## Files Changed
- ✅ **`lib/cms.ts`** - Recreated with all necessary functions
- ✅ **Uploaded to GitHub** - Ready for deployment

## Testing After Deployment
1. **Check build logs** - Should show successful compilation
2. **Visit homepage** - Featured Articles should display
3. **Check browser console** - Should see article loading logs
4. **Verify images** - Articles should show cover images

---

**This was a critical missing file that prevented the entire build from succeeding. The recreation should fix both the build error and the Featured Articles functionality.**

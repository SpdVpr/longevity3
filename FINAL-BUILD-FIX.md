# FINAL BUILD FIX: Missing Import Paths Resolved

## Build Error
The Vercel deployment was failing with multiple "Module not found" errors:
```
./app/[locale]/articles/[slug]/page.tsx
Module not found: Can't resolve '../../../../lib/cms'

./app/[locale]/articles/page.tsx
Module not found: Can't resolve '../../../lib/cms'

./app/[locale]/fitness/page.tsx
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/cms'

./app/[locale]/mental-health/page.tsx
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/cms'

./app/[locale]/nutrition/page.tsx
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/cms'
```

## Root Cause Analysis
**CRITICAL ISSUE**: Multiple files were importing from `lib/cms.ts` but this file didn't exist.

### Import Path Analysis:
1. **`app/components/FastFeaturedArticles.tsx`** - Fixed to use `../lib/cms` ✅
2. **`app/[locale]/articles/page.tsx`** - Uses `../../../lib/cms` ❌ (missing)
3. **`app/[locale]/articles/[slug]/page.tsx`** - Uses `../../../../lib/cms` ❌ (missing)
4. **Category pages** - Use `@/lib/cms` ❌ (missing)

### File Structure:
- ✅ `app/lib/cms.ts` - EXISTS (working, proper UTF-8)
- ❌ `lib/cms.ts` - MISSING (needed by multiple imports)

## Solution Applied
**Re-export Wrapper**: Created `lib/cms.ts` as a lightweight wrapper that re-exports functions from `app/lib/cms.ts`.

### Created File: `lib/cms.ts`
```typescript
/**
 * CMS service - Re-exports from app/lib/cms.ts
 * This file exists to maintain compatibility with existing imports
 */

// Re-export all functions from app/lib/cms.ts
export {
  getArticles,
  getArticlesByCategory
} from '../app/lib/cms';

// For compatibility with other imports that might expect these functions
export async function getCategoryArticles(category: string, page = 1, pageSize = 10, locale = 'en') {
  const { getArticlesByCategory } = await import('../app/lib/cms');
  return getArticlesByCategory(category, page, pageSize, locale);
}
```

## Why This Solution Works

1. **Maintains All Import Paths**: 
   - `@/lib/cms` ✅ (resolves to `lib/cms.ts`)
   - `../../../lib/cms` ✅ (resolves to `lib/cms.ts`)
   - `../../../../lib/cms` ✅ (resolves to `lib/cms.ts`)

2. **No Code Duplication**: Re-exports from existing `app/lib/cms.ts`

3. **Proper UTF-8 Encoding**: Created using save-file tool, not PowerShell

4. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing imports continue to work

5. **Single Source of Truth**: All logic remains in `app/lib/cms.ts`

## Import Resolution Map

### Before (BROKEN):
```
app/components/FastFeaturedArticles.tsx → ../lib/cms → app/lib/cms.ts ✅
app/[locale]/articles/page.tsx → ../../../lib/cms → lib/cms.ts ❌ (missing)
app/[locale]/articles/[slug]/page.tsx → ../../../../lib/cms → lib/cms.ts ❌ (missing)
app/[locale]/fitness/page.tsx → @/lib/cms → lib/cms.ts ❌ (missing)
```

### After (WORKING):
```
app/components/FastFeaturedArticles.tsx → ../lib/cms → app/lib/cms.ts ✅
app/[locale]/articles/page.tsx → ../../../lib/cms → lib/cms.ts ✅ → app/lib/cms.ts ✅
app/[locale]/articles/[slug]/page.tsx → ../../../../lib/cms → lib/cms.ts ✅ → app/lib/cms.ts ✅
app/[locale]/fitness/page.tsx → @/lib/cms → lib/cms.ts ✅ → app/lib/cms.ts ✅
```

## Expected Results

### Build Should Succeed:
- ✅ No more "Module not found" errors
- ✅ All import paths resolve correctly
- ✅ Vercel deployment should complete successfully

### All Pages Should Work:
- ✅ **Homepage** - Featured Articles should display
- ✅ **Articles page** - Should show articles with images
- ✅ **Category pages** - Fitness, Mental Health, Nutrition should work
- ✅ **Individual article pages** - Should display properly

## Files Changed
- ✅ **`lib/cms.ts`** - Created as re-export wrapper
- ✅ **Uploaded to GitHub** - Ready for deployment

## Testing After Deployment
1. **Check build logs** - Should show successful compilation
2. **Visit all pages**:
   - Homepage → Featured Articles should display
   - /articles → Should show articles with images
   - /fitness, /mental-health, /nutrition → Should work
   - Individual article pages → Should display
3. **Check browser console** - Should see normal loading logs

---

**This is the final fix that should resolve all build errors and make all pages functional. The re-export wrapper maintains compatibility while using the existing working code.**
